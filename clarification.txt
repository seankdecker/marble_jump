I finally want to solve that one game at my
grandma's house. It has a bunch of pretty marbles 
that you continually jump over each other until 
hopefully one remains. I've never known the name of
the game but apparently it is called "peg solitaire".
I found this name a little dissapointing though 
because it admits that the game is of British origin.
I've only ever seen the game at my grandma's or uncle's
house so I always assumed it to be Japanese. So I
renamed it ペグ・ソリテール (peg solitaire in Japanese).
